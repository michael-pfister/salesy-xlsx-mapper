# How to ask chatGPT to find matches

1. ```I am going to give you a list of industry sectors within two messages```
2. Give ChatGPT the shorter list (in this case subsectors) within two or more messages dependent on if it reaches the character limit.
3. ```Find the best match from the list I gave you for the industry [your industry]```
4. ```Do the same thing for all the other industries I am going to send you```
5. Copy Paste any industry and chatGPT will find a match
